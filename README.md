# Mamma Mia's
## Mama Mia Group met through Zoom and Discord to discuss ideas and apply the analytical process to the following question: 
## “I am looking to open a pizza restaurant, what suggestions do you have for success?”
## This question was reframed to, what opportunities do you have to maximize profit? From there we figured out what information we needed to identify this opportunity. We extracted our information from the “sum_23” pizza database, as well as information from CNY Weather. We then created and discussed data that was important for us to use, we discussed joins and worked with SQL to join tables together. With the data, we created a couple of tables and discussed the trends and relationships of the data. Lastly, we built a presentation for the CEO that tells a story. 

# Graph #1a: Rain and Snow on Revenue Per Month
# Graph #1b: Snow and Revenue 
# Graph #1c: Rainfall and Revenue 
	
## When reviewing the revenue over time we noticed that our green line revenue had some erratic patterns that seemed random. So we decided to check the rainfall and snowfall weather data online. We took those values from an online weather website and imported them into Python through Excel. We found an inverse relationship that explains how weather can be used as a predictive model for profit. Looking at long-range weather forecasts online we can see how the future is expected to perform. When the weather is expected to be harsh, is when the restaurant should be focusing on tasks that can be done during downtime to prepare for peak traffic seasons. Including managing the kitchen, training employees, fixing machines or cooking stations, updating computers, administrative tasks, etc. 

## During the months which are expected to be nice weather we need to make sure that the structure of the restaurant is fully ready to handle peak traffic. 


# Graph #2: Sum of Quantity Sold By the Hour 

## For this graph, we wanted to get a closer look at the hours when the store was the busiest and selling the most. With the extracted data we decided to create a graph that will tell us the dum of the quantity sold by the hour, for the whole year. After creating this we noticed when the store was at its busiest and when the store was at its slowest; with this information, we discussed that downtime should be used to prepare and prepare for busy hours, and advertisements and specials should be advertised at certain hours.

# Graph #3: Quantity Sold and Total Revenue by Pizza Size

## When extracting our data we noticed that each pizza came in different sizes, some pizzas only came in one size. This information led us to create a graph in Python based on quantity and total revenue sold by pizza size. We noticed that large and medium pizzas sold a lot more than XL and XXL. We then compared this graph with graph 4 which tells us the revenue by pizza type. We noticed that some of the top 15 pizzas came in only one size. Therefore this graph is valuable information to discuss if we want to include more sizes in certain pizzas to create a profit or remove some sizes that aren’t profitable. 

# Graph #4: Revenue by Pizza Type Heat Graph
## This graph was created to take a closer look at the top 15 pizza types, although there is around 30 different type of pizza we wanted to look at the ones that brought in the most revenue. After creating the graph through Python, we were able to discuss the importance of the graph such as it being able to identify what pizza types are performing best throughout the year, can be used to know what ingredients are needed to stock up on, and what pizzas are most favorable for advertisement.
