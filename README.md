# Python for Business Analytics 

Welcome to the Python for Business Analytics summer course repository. This project features a comprehensive analysis for opening a pizza restaurant.

## Project Overview
I was given an operational database of a pizza restaurant, and my task was to provide opportunities for success for the restaurant through a report after first preparing the data with MySQL. I cleaned up the data with Python and Pandas and used the data available to me to visualize the most critical takeaways from the year's worth of data. I then added interactivity and pushed it to a web app, allowing the user to explore the data themselves. I used the dash libraries to incorporate CSS and html into python code, allowing me to stylize the website and provide interactivy to the user.

## How to Navigate
The interactive dashboard allows for an intuitive exploration of the data, providing actionable insights and a visually engaging experience for all stakeholders interested in the success of a pizza restaurant venture.
